## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role**: Data science team developing a public facing data visualization tool.

**Target audience:** Individuals interested in understanding mental health trends in the technology industry, including students, tech workers, and the general public.

Mental health is an important aspect of the technology field, which is characterized by a high workload and stressful conditions. However, it is hard to comprehend the connection between different workforce characteristics, company size, benefits, and mental health topics, and this may contribute to an increase in awareness and comprehension of mental health in the technology field. In order to achieve the proposed goal, we propose building an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore trends in the Mental Health in Tech survey data. The dashboard will provide visualizations of mental health indicators and workplace support factors, enabling users to compare different groups and better understand patterns within the data.
